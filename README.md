# MCMC Gibbs sampling algorithm

This repository contains a simple Bayesian inference program written in Python. It uses the MCMC algorithm with Gibbs sampling to estimate probability values of the query.

The implementation can be found in the `gibbs_sampling.py` file. Additionaly, `bayes_example.py` shows the format in which the Bayesian network has to be in order for the program to work.
The repository also contains the Jupyter notebook file with conducted experiments (the notebook is in Polish)
